## Plot: Average sales price by zipcode in Staten Island in 2016

## Clarity:

- The plot(map) is easy to read and the size is proper. Apart from the zip code '10314', which is a little difficult to read as it clashes with the boundary of the area, all the 
zip codes can be seen in their respective areas with clear boundaries.

- I feel a change can be made in the range of sale prices for which the classification is made. 
One has to look at the legend for a while to understand the range of values of the different 
categories. For example, it can be made more intuitive by starting the price from $400,000 and
 making classes for every $50,000.
 
- In the values for the legend, the currency of the sale prices could be added ($).
